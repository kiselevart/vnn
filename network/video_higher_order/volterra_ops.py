"""
Shared Volterra interaction primitives for 3D video models.

Volterra series expansion up to 3rd order:
    y = h0 + Σ h1(i)·x(i) + Σ h2(i,j)·x(i)·x(j) + Σ h3(i,j,k)·x(i)·x(j)·x(k)

Decomposition strategies:
    2nd-order (quadratic):  CP factorization    → left · right   (2·Q·C channels)
    3rd-order symmetric:    Tied CP factors      → a² · b         (2·Q·C channels)
    3rd-order general:      Independent factors  → a · b · c      (3·Q·C channels)
